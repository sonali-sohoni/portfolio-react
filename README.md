# React Portfolio -Sonali Sohoni


## Objectives
* Understand and implement basic concepts React,React Hooks 

## User Story
* AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
* I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Mock up

* GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
* WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
* WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
* WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
* WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
* WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
* WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
* WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
* WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
* WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
* WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
* WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
* WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
